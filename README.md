# LightLib Library Management System (LMS)

A lightweight library management system built in .NET 5.0 with Entity Framework Core.  Enables library administrators to manage Library Assets, Patrons, and Branches with basic functionality.

This project is intended to serve as a long-term resource for small .NET web monoliths.

## Stack

## Video Series

I created a YouTube series when I started this application: [YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTVcLFTgDqs)
The application has since been migrated to .NET 5.0 with significant changes to architecture and implementation.  A new video series is in the works.
